# The Code Arena - Seasons of Code - (WnCC) 
Welcome to The Code Arena - SOC for Competitive Programming !

This Git-Hub Repository will be the main space - Where we'll share Essential Reading materials to build your foundation , followed by curated problems from CSES , Codeforces , Leetcode and more .
You'll be solving these problems and uploading your solutions in your designated folder

Let’s stay consistent, challenge ourselves, and level up together in the world of competitive programming!

# Week 1 (26 May - 2 June)

- Complete reading the first 4 chapters from [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf).
- Create your accounts on [CSES](https://cses.fi/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/), and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
- If you wish to study any of the data structures in detail, then please use this [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/). But I believe you will be able to pick up all the data structures knowledge as you will move forward. So, no need to memorize stuff, you will be able to learn through practice.
- Go through your CS101 slides or the link for basic algorithms such as [binary search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/) and sorting algorithms.
- Then read this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lx9sbsxWOVrGgeCplCMAdscvZazTTKQPDZnZpCH0CLo/edit) thoroughly. If you have any questions on this document, please feel free to ask in the group.
- You need to submit only the first set of the following questions in your corresponding folder. Also, your code should pass all the test cases present on either CSES or Codeforces.

## Questions to be submitted:
1. [Missing Number](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1083) (`w1_q1.cpp`) [[Solution](https://cses.fi/problemset/result/)]
2. [Repetitions](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1069) (`w1_q2.cpp`) [[Solution](https://cses.fi/problemset/result/)]
3. [Coins](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1617) (`w1_q3.cpp`) [[Solution](https://cses.fi/problemset/result/)]
4. [Lucky Numbers](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1090) (`w1_q4.cpp`) [[Solution](https://cses.fi/problemset/result/)]
5. [Weird Algorithm](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1068) (`w1_q5.cpp`) [[Solution](https://cses.fi/problemset/result/)]

## Questions for your practice:
1. [Increasing Array](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1094) [[Solution](https://cses.fi/problemset/result/)]
2. [Towers of Hanoi](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2165) [[Solution](https://cses.fi/problemset/result/)]
3. [Coin Piles](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1754) [[Solution](https://cses.fi/problemset/result/)]
4. [Walking Master](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1753) [[Solution](https://cses.fi/problemset/result/)]
5. [Two Knights](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1072) [[Solution](https://cses.fi/problemset/result/)]

> All those who are new to CP, this week is going to be a bit heavy. Feel free to ask us for more time. But make sure that you complete all the questions honestly, else this project won’t be able to help you much.
